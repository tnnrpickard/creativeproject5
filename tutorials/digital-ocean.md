# Installing on Digital Ocean

This tutorial will show you how to setup your web application on Digital Ocean. Prior to this tutorial you should have:

- an account on a Digital Ocean server
- a domain name
- configuration of your domain name so that `yourdomain.com` points to the IP address of your server
- configuration of your domain name so that `*.yourdomain.com` likewise points to the IP address of your server.
- your ssh keys are already stored on your server in ~/.ssh

## Install Mongo

Let's install MongoDB on your server. We will use the Ubuntu packages for this. Mongo recommends you use their official packages, but I have never had a problem with the Ubuntu packages.

Run the following:

```
sudo apt install mongodb
```

That should be it! You can verify that it is running:

```
sudo systemctl status mongodb
```

You should see a status that says `active (running)`. If you ever need to `stop`, `start`, or `restart` Mongo, you can subsitute those command for `status`.

## Configure nginx

We need to configure your web server, nginx, so that it has a new server block for this lab. Let's assume it is called `lab4.yourdomain.com`. Substitute your own domain as needed.

Navigate to the directory where nginx sites are configured:

```
cd /etc/nginx/sites-available
```

Create a new file there:

```
sudo touch lab4.yourdomain.com
```

Edit this file with the editor of your choice. Be sure to use sudo. Put the following there:

```
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name lab4.yourdomain.com;
  root /var/www/lab4.yourdomain.com;
  index index.html;
  default_type "text/html";
  location / {
    # Serve static files from the root location above.
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
  }
  location /api {
    # Serve api requests here. This will connect to your node
    # process that is running on port 3000.
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
  }
}
```

This will setup nginx so that any requests to `lab4.yourdomain.com` go to `/var/www/lab4.yourdomain.com`, except if the request starts with `/api`. In that case, the request will be routed to your Node server running on port 3000.

This setup is called a _reverse proxy_. If you want to setup another application, say `cp4.yourdomain.com`, you can do that, but you need to run the Node server for that application on a different port.

The next step is to link this into the `sites-enabled` directory:

```
cd ../sites-enabled
sudo ln -s ../sites-available/lab5.mydomain.com .
```

You should be able to see that this is working properly:

```
ls -al
```

You will see something like this:

```
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   34 Mar 14 01:20 lab5.mydomain.com -> ../sites-available/lab5.mydomain.com
```

This shows that the file is linked correctly. You can also try using `cat` to view the file and make sure it looks right.

The final step is to reload nginx so that this configuration takes effect:

```
sudo nginx -s reload
```

If nginx fails to reload properly, then most likely you have a syntax error in the configuration for a host, or your soft link (from `ln -s`) is incorrect.

## Install nvm

Navigate to [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) and find the curl command used to install nvm.

For example:

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
```

Then install the stable version of node and npm and use it:

```
source ~/.bashrc
nvm install stable
nvm use stable
```

## Clone your code

Clone your repository into your **home directory**. For example:

```
cd ~/
git clone
cd lab4
```

## Fix your node configuration

We setup node for your local machine. There are two things we need to change in `server.js`. First, comment out this line because we are not using node to serve files in the public directory:

```
// app.use(express.static('public'));
```

Second, make sure you configure multer so that it stores files in your public web server directory. For example:

```
const upload = multer({
  dest: '/var/www/lab4.mydomain.com/images/',
  limits: {
    fileSize: 10000000
  }
});
```

You need to change `dest` so that it points to the correct directory.

## Setup Node

Now install the packages you will need:

```
npm install
```

This will find all the packages in package-lock.json and install them into this directory.

Make sure your server runs:

```
node server.js
```

You just want to make sure it starts without errors. Kill it after you check this with `control-c`.

## Setup your public files

Now copy your public files to `/var/www`. For example:

```
sudo mkdir /var/www/lab4.mydomain.com
sudo chown zappala /var/www/lab4.mydomain.com
cp -rp public/* /var/www/lab4.mydomain.com/
```

## Run node forever

We will use an node library called [forever](https://github.com/foreverjs/forever) to run node -- it will keep running even if you log out.

```
npm install forever -g
```

Note that we use the `-g` option to install `forever` globally. This way it will be available to all apps on our machine.

You can run your server now with:

```
forever start server.js
```

You can check its status with:

```
forever list
```

Note that this will show the log file where output from `server.js` will be stored. This will come in handy!

You can also use:

```
forever stop 0
```

to stop forever job number 0.

## Testing

Everything should be setup. You should be able to browse to your site, e.g `lab4.mydomain.com` and have the site work.

## Debugging

If your site is not working, you should (1) look at the JavaScript console, (2) look at the Network tab in Developer Tools, (3) look at the output of the forever log (see above).
