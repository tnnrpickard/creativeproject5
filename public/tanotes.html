    <h1> For the TAs</h1>
    <p> I didn't put in all of the features that I wanted to (fighter pictures, actual fighting, leaderboard), but I believe the fundamental parts of the project are met.</p>
    <p> I used Mongo to store the fighters, and there is a node backend keeping everything together. There is a Vue front-end as well. I hope that this suffices, because I am proud of this thing, and hope to use it as a playground for future development.</p>
